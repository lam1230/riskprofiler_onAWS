            <h4>Information and conditions about melanoma risk estimation:</h4>

            <p>Your personal melanoma risk provides an estimation of your risk of developing a first primary 
                invasive melanoma during the rest of your life. It is based on the best available information, however these 
                risk prediction tools are the subject of ongoing research and will continue to be refined. The risks for each factor 
                that were selected to calculate your personal melanoma risk contain some uncertainty. This means that your actual personal 
                risk could be different from your personal risk estimate. If your personal risk factors change,for example if you develop new skin cancers or experience 
                a change in family history then your personal risk estimate may also change.</p><br> 

            <p> Melanoma is a dangerous type of skin cancer. Your personal melanoma risk does not include your risk of developing melanoma in situ or 
                other types of skin cancer, including basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Some risk factors, such as immunosuppression, 
                are not included in the risk calculation given the small number of studies available from which to draw conclusions and the limited population for whom they are relevant. 
                Your risk estimate is also based on living in Australia, so may be less accurate for people who have lived overseas.</p><br>

            <p>Anyone is at risk of developing melanoma, even if you receive a low-risk estimate. Not everyone with higher than average 
                risk will develop melanoma, and some people at lower than average risk will still develop melanoma. Being aware of your 
                risk is important, as it is the first step in taking precautions to reduce your risk.</p><br>

            <p>Your personal risk estimate is not intended to be used as a substitute for your doctor's advice. 
                It is highly recommended that you discuss your personal risk factors and the results of your risk assessment 
                with your health care professional. If you have any questions or concerns about your skin, particularly if you 
                have noticed any changes, please seek advice from your doctor.</p><br>
